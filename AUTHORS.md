## Note from the Author

Hi, it's me, SlimeMaid!

with the creation of this game, I'm eternally grateful for assisting in making
this be the best possible game it can be.

Note from SlimeMaid:

  "I love emamouse's music and graphic art. It's so far out, it's totally
unlike anything I've ever seen or heard. I love you emamouse. You have changed
me as an artist and introduced me to a new world. Having you do 4 songs for
this game is the greatest gift anyone could have ever given me. You fill me
with determination to get this game done."

trans culture, so I wanted to rope her into doing something for the project."

Graphic art, namely:

make good art but they can do it so quickly... it's amazing. They have a really
cool style, but is also very versatile.
